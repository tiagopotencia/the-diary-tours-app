We have the typical Cordova style project structure, just with a couple more files (like <strong>tsconfig.json</strong> which is for TypeScript and <strong>webpack.config.js</strong> which is for Webpack).</p>\n<p>\tIf you look in the <strong>app</strong> folder though, things start looking a little bit different:</p>\n<p>\t<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.joshmorony.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/structure-v1-v2.png\" style=\"width: 408px; height: 372px;\"></p>\n<p>\t<strong>UPDATE:</strong> In the latest version of Ionic 2 the file structure looks a little different to this. The <strong>app</strong> folder now sits outside of the <strong>www</strong> folder and there&rsquo;s a few more <strong>.scss</strong> files.</p>\n<p>\tUsually in an Ionic 1 application, people would have all of their Javascript files (controllers, services etc.) in one folder, all of the templates in another folder, and all of the styling information would usually be contained in a single <strong>app.scss</strong> file.</p>\n<p>\tThe default structure for an Ionic 2 application organises by functionality, so you have all of the logic, templates and styling for a particular component (in the example above we have a basic page component, a list component, and an item details component) in the one spot. This plays in well with the Angular 2 methodology of having everything be standalone components that can easily be reused in other places or projects. If you wanted to reuse a particular feature, or have lots of people working on the same project, the old Ionic 1 approach can become quite troublesome.</p>\n<p>\tThe idea of organising code by feature is not particular to Angular 2 &amp; Ionic 2, in fact people were using and advocating for the feature based approach in Ionic 1 applications, it&rsquo;s just that most people were doing it the other way. With the way Angular 2 works though, using the feature based structure makes a lot more sense.&quot;</p>\n<p>\tFor more info read: <a href=\"http://www.joshmorony.com/ionic-2-first-look-series-your-first-ionic-2-app-explained/\">Ionic 2 First Look Series: Your First Ionic 2 App Explained</a></p>\n"},{"title": "ES2015","id": "es2015","content": "<p>\tBy default Ionic 2 allow you to start a project with ES2015, to stay up-to-date with the new way to work with Ionic see this <a href=\"https://babeljs.io/docs/learn-es2015/\">Guide</a>.</p>\n"},{"title": "Usage","id": "usage","content": "<ol>\n\t<li>\t\tInstall Ionic CLI `npm install -g ionic@beta`, please setting Ionic CLI work before next step.
